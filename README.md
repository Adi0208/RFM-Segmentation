# RFM-Segmentation:-  Build an RFM segmentation of these customers using Python. 
    The segmentation should build relevant clusters, show how these segments differ from each other (KPIs),
    and explain the engagement strategy for each segment, i.e. how should the brand be engaging these customers,
    what type of campaigns they should run, and how will this affect the KPIs.
